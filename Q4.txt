Q-4, part a

Four different modes (excluding read and write) used with open() in Python:
'a' – Append mode: Opens a file for writing, appending content at the end if the file exists.
'x' – Exclusive creation mode: Creates a new file and throws an error if the file already exists.
'b' – Binary mode: Opens the file in binary format (used for images, PDFs, etc.).
't' – Text mode: Opens the file in text mode (default mode). 

part b 
Why readlines() is inefficient for large files:
readlines() reads the entire file into memory as a list, which can cause memory issues for very large files.
More efficient method:
Use a loop to read the file line by line:
with open("file.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        # read the line

part c 
why is it important to close files:
If files are not closed, it can lead to memory leaks, file corruption, or too many open file handles, which can crash programs.        

How with ensures proper resource management:
The with statement automatically closes the file after its block is executed, even when an error occurs. 
Example:
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
# file is automatically closed here

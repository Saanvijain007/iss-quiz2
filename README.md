# iss-quiz2
This repo contains the answers to all the questions in quiz 2 of the course INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

For question 2, I have made different files for each script. Same goes for question 3 
The first 2 parts of question 5 are included in Q5.txt. For part c, I have made a separate file Q5_c.py to include the code.
